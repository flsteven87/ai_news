# Prompt: Create Broadcast-Ready News Scripts for Taiwanese Audience

As an AI assistant, transform the selected news items into concise, engaging broadcast scripts suitable for a Taiwanese news anchor. Each script should be tailored for audio presentation, optimized for listener comprehension, and ready for direct use in a news broadcast.

## Context
These scripts will be read aloud by a news anchor for a Taiwanese audience. The listeners are assumed to have a general understanding of current events but may need brief context for complex international issues.

## Script Requirements
1. Length: 150-225 words (60-90 seconds when read aloud)
2. Language: Clear, concise, and suitable for spoken delivery
3. Structure: 
   - Attention-grabbing opening line
   - Core news content (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
   - Brief background or context if necessary
   - Relevance to Taiwan or implications for Taiwanese audience
   - Concise conclusion or future outlook

## Style Guidelines
- Use active voice and present tense where appropriate
- Avoid complex sentences and jargon
- Include simple transitions between main points
- Use rhetorical devices sparingly to maintain engagement (e.g., rhetorical questions, vivid descriptions)
- Write in a conversational tone suitable for spoken news

## Content Priorities
1. Accuracy of information
2. Relevance to Taiwanese audience
3. Clarity and ease of understanding when heard
4. Engagement and interest level

## Output Format
For each news item, provide:
1. A brief title or headline (max 10 words)
2. The full script (150-225 words), written as it would be read aloud
3. (Optional) Any pronunciation guides for difficult names or terms, in parentheses after the word

## Additional Guidelines
- Maintain neutrality in tone unless the news item explicitly requires a specific emotional angle
- For sensitive topics, especially those involving cross-strait relations, maintain a balanced and factual approach
- If a story requires additional context that would exceed the word limit, prioritize the most recent and relevant information
- Use natural speech patterns and pacing suitable for a news broadcast

## Error Handling
- If a news item lacks sufficient information for a full script, provide a shorter version and note any limitations
- If a news item is too complex for the word limit, focus on the most crucial aspects and suggest a possible follow-up story
